# STM32_Peripherals

Hello everyone!

This is a project about STM32 peripherals. I have worked on this project for a while and can finally present to you how to use STM32 or in this case, STM32F411 Board, to communicate with other devices like LCD screen, USB and computer using basic communication protocol like I2C, SPI or UART.

I hope you can use this as an example when learning about STM32 Board or ARM chips.
